                <para>
		  An OSTree repository is structurally similar to a
		  git repository; it is a content-addressed object
		  store containing filesystem trees.  However, unlike
		  git, ostree is designed to store operating system
		  binaries.  It records the Unix uid and gid,
		  permissions, as well as extended attributes.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		  A repository can be in one of two modes;
		  <literal>bare</literal>, which is designed as a hard
		  link source for operating system checkouts, and
		  <literal>archive-z2</literal>, which is designed for
		  static HTTP servers.
		</para>

		<para>
		  There is a system repository located at
		  <filename>/ostree/repo</filename>.  If no repository
		  is specified -- either by a command-line option or the
		  <envar>OSTREE_REPO</envar> environment variable --
		  the <command>ostree</command> as well as many API
		  calls will use it by default.
		</para>
        </refsect1>

		  The only user-editable component is the
