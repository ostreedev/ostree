/* The high level goal of this code is to run inside
 * the initial ram disk (if one is in use) and set up the `/` mountpoint
 * to be the deployment root, using the ostree= kernel commandline
 * argument to find the target deployment root.
 *
 * It's really the heart of how ostree works - basically multiple
 * hardlinked chroot() targets are maintained, this one does the equivalent
 * of chroot().
 *
 * This -static.c variant of ostree-prepare-root is designed for
 * the case where an initrd isn't used - instead the binary must be statically linked (and the
 * kernel must have mounted the rootfs itself) - then we set things up and exec the real init
 * directly.  This can be popular in embedded systems to increase bootup speed.
 *
 * Note that as of lately, good tools exist for embedding an initramfs
 * inside a kernel binary, and this can help avoid static linking.
