# There is no clean way to restart hosts in ansible. The general issue is that
# the shutdown command may close sshd before ansible has time to "return" from
# the task, even with async & poll. This is due to the fact that asynchronous
# tasks still require a small synchronous bootstrapping script which takes 1 sec
# to complete, during which it is vulnerable to erroring out if sshd dies.
#       To mitigate this, we prefix a sleep command before the shutdown so
# ansible has time to move on. For more info on this issue, see:
# https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/10616
#
# The Ansible docs now recommend this combination of tasks to handle reboots
